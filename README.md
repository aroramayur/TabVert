TabVert
=======

So what this does is pretty simple. 

It lists all open tabs across <b>all open windows</b> vertically - just those pretty favicons really and lets you move 
seamlessly across them. Shows paths to existing bookmarks and lets you create new ones under 'other bookmarks'

If you've come so far , why not install 'TabVert'. So get it here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabvert/mccadpemnbkkcnbeoibpbacaehcmnifp
Will warn you 'can read your browsing history'. Trust me, I am not NSA.

What went into this : Javascript (promises/A+), Knockout JS
