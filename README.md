TabVert
=======

So what this does is pretty simple. Nothing NASAesque here . 

It lists all open tabs across all open windows vertically - just those pretty favicons reallly and lets you move 
seamlessly across tabs.

If you've come so far , why not install 'TabVert'. So get it here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabvert/mccadpemnbkkcnbeoibpbacaehcmnifp
Will warn you 'can read your browsing history'. Trust me, I am not NSA.
