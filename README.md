TabVert
=======

So what this does is pretty simple. Nothing NASAesque here . 

It lists all open tabs across all open windows vertically - just those pretty favicons reallly and lets you move 
seamlessly across tabs.

Just get hold of the crx file and drop it at chrome://extensions - yes that is a valid url in chrome.
Will warn you 'can read your browsing history'. Trust me, I am not NSA.
